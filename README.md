### Everything here uses minescript(potentially with minescript plus)

Hello peeps! If you're looking to engage in minecraft macroes, then this is the place for you. 

Within this repository, there will be multiple kinds of macro, in text form(No file, no download). This code is used within the mod minescript [Minescript](https://modrinth.com/mod/minescript). Refer to their documentation(Listed on the modrinth) for further development on macroes. Any issues unrelated to the script(aka launch errors, minescript refuses to load. etc. Should be directed towards their discord server and #troubleshooting)
